# Cayley The Bot

I need a study buddy for math, so I'm attempting to create Cayley: The Discord Bot that sends me neatly Latex-rendered puzzles he gathered from Stack Exchange (mainly math and programming) on requests; or questions from the materials of my courses at uni. Cayley has DeepEmoji in the backend, so it sometimes spontaneously reacts to my rants, or send me some memes from the mighty Internet.
